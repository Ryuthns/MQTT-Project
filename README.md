## Overview
In this project, we will use our program to detect smoker in public areas with the help of haar cascade which is a feature in [Violaâ€“Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola%E2%80%93Jones_object_detection_framework). Once detected, the program will publish an image of smoker along with location and time to client side using MQTT broker and SFTP protocol.

> Each directory is included with an explanation for each part of the project.
