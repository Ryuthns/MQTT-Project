## Overview
In this project, we will use our program to detect smoker in public areas with the help of haar cascade which is a feature in [Viola–Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola%E2%80%93Jones_object_detection_framework). Once detected, the program will publish an image of smoker along with location to client side through MQTT broker.

## Additions
• Local broker (Hamachi)  <br/>
• Send images using HTTP instead <br/>
• Camera specs  <br/>
• Replace Location with camera ID  <br/>
• Test and Optimize Viola-Jones <br/>
• Detect face along with ciga <br/>
• Train openCV more <br/>

## Hamachi (Linux)
