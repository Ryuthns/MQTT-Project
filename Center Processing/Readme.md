# Face Detection
We will be using openCV and viola-jones algorithm for detection. <br/>
**- Why OpenCV and Viola-Jones ?** <br/>
- **OpenCV** : It's open source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. It also has real-time operation which is very important. <br/>
- **Viola-Jones** : It's well known for its reputation and reliability. It's exceptionally notable in real-time face detection. <br/>

There are two stages of Viola-Jones which is training and detection.

# GUI Application
On this side, we will use tkinter which is a package in python for creating GUI. It's easy to use which will make coding much faster when compared to using other programming languages.

# Save-file and Send-file
Texts will be sent via MQTT while pictures will be sent via the help of http.
