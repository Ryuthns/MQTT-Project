# Monitor GUI Application
On this side, we created a GUI application using GTK in C language. Our app will act as a monitor to receive images sent from the program on center processing side.

## How it works
We can put in the ID of 3 cameras that we want to watch.

Once we clicked start, we will be moved to another page that shows images from Cameras that we chose. If no images have been sent, "No image available" will be shown instead.
